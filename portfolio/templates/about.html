    <h2>Welcome to my portfolio page!</h2>
    <p>I am an IT enginner with 6 years of experience in industry. My main duties before development were designing and implementing standardized and customer specific monitoring and asset discovery solutions. I enjoy creative work, where mix of reason and beauty meet to satisfy the demand, hence coding is a wind for my sail.</p>
    <p>
        In my free time I enjoy reading books, I am a big fan of sci-fi. Once a while I play some PC game. I used to play some desk games too, but that was way too time consuming to be combined with my work and daddy duties. I will get back to those once retired.
