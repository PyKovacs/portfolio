    <h2>Welcome to my portfolio page!</h2>
    <p>I am an IT enginner with 6 years of experience in industry.  I enjoy creative work, where mix of reason and beauty meet to satisfy the demand, hence coding is a wind for my sail.</p>

    <p>
        In my free time I enjoy reading books, I am a big fan of sci-fi. Once a while I play some PC game. I used to play XBOX for many years BC (before children), but that is long gone.
